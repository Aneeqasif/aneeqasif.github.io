It was the last stretch of my final semester in uni—the most chaotic, high-pressure time of the entire degree. Deadlines were stacking up, with research project presentations, thesis submissions, and exams Everyone was barely keeping it together. But my friend Junaid, ever the optimist, just wanted a break. For weeks, he’d been suggesting we take a day off, go somewhere, do something to get our minds off it all.

Every time he asked, I dodged him, again and again, with excuses about assignments, exams, or simply not having the time. But one day, when he brought it up again, I couldn’t really argue. Maybe I was finally feeling the weight of it myself, or something else, I gave in and said, “Fine, just bring the bike, and we’ll see.”

So we didn’t have a plan. But that didn’t seem to matter. When he pulled up, I hopped on, we stopped by an ATM and grabbed some cash. As we started driving away from campus, reality hit us: “Where exactly were we going?” I asked, half-laughing. Junaid glanced back, “Where do you want to go?”

For some reason, one place—a hill station—came to mind immediately. It was a crazy idea—way too far for a one-day trip. We’d have to spend most of the day just driving there and back. But the thought was there, daring us to act on it. The more ridiculous it sounded, the more it felt like the right answer.


It must have shown in my voice, because without another word, he shrugged and turned the bike in that direction. And just like that, we were off.

The ride was long—really long—but we finally made it. By the time we arrived, the sun had already set, casting a quiet, cozy vibe. We did a little bit of everything: stopped by a local restaurant, laughed with some locals, took some photos, grabbed a perfect cup of coffee, and wandered around, revisiting old memories. Time slipped by without us noticing, and before we knew it, it was pitch dark. I suggested we stay the night, but Junaid’s sister had fallen ill, and he was set on heading back. And we decided to head back.

The weather, though, was not on our side—it was extremely foggy, reducing visibility to nearly zero. At first, it was manageable; streetlights lined the way, and the road was spacious enough to drive safely. But then, all of a sudden, we were hit by pitch darkness. The front light of the bike became useless; the fog was so thick that we could barely see a few feet ahead. The roads became treacherous, twisting sharply along cliffs, and I really felt the gravity of our decision weighing down on us.

For a moment, both of us regretted the choice to ride back. I was driving, my hands were freezing and heartbeat racing with every turn we took. Every so often, a car would pass by, and we would try to rush to keep the bike behind its light, hoping it would guide us through the clueless, pitch-black darkness. But whenever we lost the trail of those headlights, we slowed down again, moving forward with painstaking caution. Just to make matters worse, it started to rain heavily, adding a slick layer of danger to the already precarious journey.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of navigating through that darkness, we neared the city. The streetlights gradually reappeared, and as we emerged from the fog, it was just like catching breath after a deep dive. The sight of the city twinkling beneath us was nothing short of majestic; just like a reflection of the starry sky above us. Relief washed over me as we finally made it back to the hostel safely, feeling a joy after that adrenaline hit.

So a couple days ago, I found myself feeling completely stuck—trapped by the weight of all these ‘what ifs’ about the future. I was trying to map out a plan, but each path seemed hazy with no sign of clarity. As I was sitting there, lost in thought, listening to an old piece by Frederic Chopin, that night flashed back into my mind so vividly, as if I could feel the cold bite of the wind, the eerie darkness, and the rain fiercely hitting our backs.

Thinking back, I realized that the uncertainty I faced that night wasn’t so different from what I felt now. Back then, I couldn’t see where I was going, only the small stretch of road right before us.

And that’s when it all clicked. When we’re caught in moments of darkness or uncertainty, sometimes we just can't see the big picture. All we can do is focus on the very next step—the one small action we can take to move forward. And if we keep at it, trusting that each step matters, one day the path will emerge, and we’ll find ourselves in a place that makes better sense.

So, my friends, that’s what I learned from that journey: when the way forward isn’t clear, don’t get stuck in 'paralysis by analysis.' Keep your ass movin'. The road has a way of revealing itself when we keep moving.

When you can’t see through the dark, focus on the step right in front of you. Each small step forward reveals the path. Keep moving; the light will follow.
