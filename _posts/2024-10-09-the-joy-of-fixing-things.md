So, I’ve had this pair of wired in-ear headphones that I bought
back in my university days. They weren’t expensive, but they’ve been a trusty companion over the years—keeping me company through late nights study sessions to watching a Kurzgesagt's videos while enjoying a meal. They’ve become a little companion of mine.

Over time, I picked up newer, fancier, more expensive Bluetooth buds. But, every now and then, I’d reach for those old wired ones. There was something about their punchy bass that just hit differently. But as with anything, time started to take its toll. The rubber casing on the wire wore off, leaving parts of the cable exposed near the mic housing. For the past month, every time I picked them up, I found myself thinking, "This is it—they’ll probably stop working this time." And yet, each time, they surprised me by still working.

This morning, I decided I couldn’t just let them fall apart like that. Sure, I have alternatives, but there’s something about those headphones that I’ve become attached to. So, I set out to fix them. I grabbed my little study lamp—which I now usually use for fiddly repairs —some super glue, a piece of cloth, and some plastic tape. I spent about half an hour carefully securing the worn-out cables, patching up the plastic casing, and reinforcing everything with tape. By the time I was done, they felt really secure and stronger—like a soldier standing tall again after a long battle.


It would’ve been very easy to toss them in the bin, since I have newer, shinier options. But there’s a quiet satisfaction and joy in giving them a second life. It’s not just about the object itself; it’s about the process. It reminds us that not everything needs to be replaced simply because it has taken a blow from time and become weary and fragile due to tough circumstances.

In a way, it reflects life. Things wear out, people get tired, but that doesn’t
mean they’re done. With a little care and attention, we can mend what’s
broken—whether it’s an old pair of headphones or parts of ourselves. There’s
beauty in the process of restoration, in taking the time to make things right
again. It’s about resilience, patience, and, maybe, a little bit of love.



So yeah, fixing those headphones made my morning. And who knows? Maybe they’ll last a few more months or even years.
