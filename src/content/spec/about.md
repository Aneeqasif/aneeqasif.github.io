# About

Hi! I'm Aneeq Asif Azad, and this is my personal corner of the internet.

This blog is where I share my thoughts on algorithms, physics, software development, and the occasional personal reflection. It's a tapestry of code, curiosity, and the lessons I've learned along the way.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Technical Posts**: Deep dives into algorithms, system programming, and software engineering
- **Personal Reflections**: Stories and thoughts about life, learning, and growth
- **Projects**: Things I'm building and experimenting with
