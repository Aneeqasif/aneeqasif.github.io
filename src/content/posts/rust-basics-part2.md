# Your First Rust Program

Let's write our first Rust program - the classic Hello World!

## Hello, World!

Create a new file `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Running the Program

```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

You should see "Hello, World!" printed to the console. Simple, right?
