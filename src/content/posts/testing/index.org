This is a sentence with a footnote[fn:1].

* Overview

This file is a *comprehensive* testbed for the custom Org → GFM Lua filter.  
It exercises:

- Metadata capture via top level ~#+KEY: VALUE~ lines go to markdown yaml frontmatter
- Internal Org links (converted from ~spurious-link~ spans to GFM links)
- Accurate Heading slugs with special characters handling
- Named tables and code blocks (~#+NAME~) → HTML anchor spans
- Code-block attributes (~:mdparams~, ~:lang~, ~:name~, etc.) passed through as Markdown fence attributes
- Org exports (~#+BEGIN_EXPORT markdown~, ~#+begin_export html~) literally to the markdown.

Use this file as a regression test when changing the filter.

* Basic Internal Links

- See [[Section Two][go to section two]] and then return via the back links below.
- See the table. [[Tables with Numbering]]


Here is a link back to the first section:

[[Section One][Back to Section One]]

A link *without* an explicit description (description should default to the target text):

With out title [[Section One]]

*** Section One

A reciprocal link back to itself (useful for testing idempotence):

[[Section One][Back to Section One]]

** Slug & Heading Tests

We now test headings and links that stress slug generation.

[[My heading (v2)]]
** Intro & Usage

The following link target includes punctuation and mixed case:

So this [[C++ Memory Model]]

** C++ Memory Model

Heading to test plus signs and spaces. The link above should correctly point here.

** My heading (v2)

A heading with parentheses and version information.

Back link to ~Intro & Usage~:

[[Intro & Usage]]

** Tables and Named Anchors

This link should resolve to the named table below:

[[Name & of my++ table (v1)][My simple table down below]]

*** Tables with Numbering

Named table (tests ~#+NAME~ → ~<span id="...">~ anchor, with complex name):

#+NAME: Name & of my++ table (v1)
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------+----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |

Named code block (also testing ~#+NAME~ anchors for ~CodeBlock~):

#+NAME: Name & of my++ code (v2)
#+BEGIN_SRC python
print("Hello")
#+END_SRC

A reference link that should point to the table anchor above:

[[Name & of my++ code (v2)][This takes me to code block]]

* Testing Heading Tags and folds

** Heading with attach tag :ATTACH:

This heading's tag will not be visible.

** A heading with tags :Demo:Markup:ATTACH:Fold:

this heading has tags, one hidden one and it is foldable.

** A foldable heading :Fold:
this heading is foldable and initialy expanded state

** Folded heading :folded:
this is also foldable but initialy collapsed 

** Section Two :folded:
this is also foldable but initialy collapsed 


* Exported Markdown & HTML Snippets

The following block is exported as raw Markdown inside Org.  
It should pass through untouched and be rendered as-is in Markdown output.


** Example Blocks
An example block showing a text table from a tool

#+begin_example
+-------------+---------------------------+
| schema_name |       function_name       |
+-------------+---------------------------+
|  pg_catalog |     shobj_description     |
|  pg_catalog |         pg_typeof         |
|  pg_catalog |     pg_type_is_visible    |
|  pg_catalog | pg_ts_template_is_visible |
|  pg_catalog |  pg_ts_parser_is_visible  |
+-------------+---------------------------+
#+end_example

Raw HTML export (should be passed through untouched):

#+begin_export html
<span style="None">The &#x27;toml&#x27; package isn&#x27;t installed. To load settings from pyproject.toml or ~/.jupysql/config, install with: pip install toml</span>
#+end_export
