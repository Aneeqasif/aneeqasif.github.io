# Introduction to Rust

Welcome to the first part of our Rust series! In this post, we'll cover the basics of Rust and why it's become so popular.

## Why Rust?

Rust offers:
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- High performance
- Great tooling
- Friendly community

## Installing Rust

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

That's it for part 1! Next, we'll write our first Rust program.
